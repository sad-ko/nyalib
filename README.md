# Nyalib (Manager Manager)

A small lib made for academic and entertainment purpose (just wanted to check if C can have a RAII implementation, spoiler: it kinda has with the gcc compiler).

This lib contains:
- Nyatring (String Manager)
- Nyarror (Error Manager)
- Nyanory (Memory Manager)

[Must compile with the GCC compiler]
